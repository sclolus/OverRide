okay, input to stdin of ./level06 a first line "aaaaaa"
then a number (which does not matter for now);

Now in auth(), lots of computations take place but that's ok.
there is a ptrace preventing us of going at the end of the computation to check the value which is used to check our second line (which is a password).
However nothing is preventing us from copying the binary and modifying the copy.
So go change the 0x75 of the conditional jump after ptrace in auth by 0x74. (This inverts the condition).
And now make a breakpoint at the end condition of the algorithm to get our value, then insert it as second input line in decimal. and you've got a SUID shell.
